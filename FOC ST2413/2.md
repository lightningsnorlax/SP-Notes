## Binary, Hex, Den conversion:

| Conversion        | Steps |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| Denary -> Binary  | 1. Draw a table with three columns – one column for denary numbers, one column for the quotients and one column for the remainders. |
|                   | 2. Fill in the denary number in the first row. |
|                   | 3. Divide the denary number by 2 and fill in its quotient and remainder in the same row. |
|                   | 4. If the quotient is 0, proceed to Step 5. Otherwise, copy the quotient to the denary number column of the next row and repeat Step 3.|
|                   | 5. The equivalent binary number is the remainder column read from the bottom up. |
| Binary -> Denary  | 1. identify all the 1 bits and their locations. |
|                   | 2. record down the value of each 1 bit. Ex. 0101, the first 1 on the left = 2^2, the next is 2^0 |
|                   | 3. add all the recorded numbers up |
|Binary -> Hexadecimal| 1. split the binary up into sets of 4 bits, adding zeros in the front if necessary. |
|                   | 2. convert each set of 4 bits into denary numbers |
|                   | 3. Convert each set of denary numbers that are 1-16 into their corresponding hexadecimal character |
|                   | 4. combine the hexadecimal characters together |
|Hexadecimal -> Binary| 1. convert each character into a set of denary numbers |
|                   | 2. convert each set of denary into sets of 4 bit binary |
|                   | 3. combine all the binary sets together, removing all the zeros in front |
|Denary <-> Hexadecimal| 0-15 corresponds to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F |
