*really basic*
//      =   commented after the //. //This is a comment
/**/    =   commented inbetween the /* and */. eg. /*This is a comment*/

*Operators*:
+   =   Plus
-   =   Minus
*   =   Multiply
/   =   Divide
%   =   Remainder
**  =   To the power of

*Incremental/ Decremental operators*
++var   =   Increases value of variable by 1 before operation
var++   =   Increases value of variable by 1 after operation
--var   =   Decreases value of variable by 1 before operation
var--   =   Decreases value of variable by 1 after operation

*Comparison operators*
<   =   Less than
<=  =   Less than or equal to
>   =   Greater than
>=  =   Greater or equal to
==  =   Equal to
!=  =   Not equal to

*Boolean operators*
!   =   Not
&&  =   And
||  =   Or

*Data types*
String      =   Anything in quotes ("") eg. "This is a string 123 @#$"
Number      =   Integers or floats eg. 123 eg.123.456
Boolean     =   True of False
Null        =   Nothing eg. return Null (will return an empty value)
Undefined   =   A value that is used that has not been defined. eg. before X has been given a value: X-1 = ERROR: X has not been defined/ X is an undefined value
Array       =   An array of values, normally in a list or something similar. eg. ["string", 123, 123.456, True]

*Conversion*
String to Number    =   converts a string to a number(float or integer depending)(will only convert if the string only contains numerical values, and will give an error otherwise) eg. integer(X) - for whole numbers/ parseFloat(X) - for decimals

*Errors*
Syntax  =   You typed something wrong, whether it is an invalid operator, or variable/constant errors. Normally, the text editors auto debugger will identify this error
Runtime =   When requests take too long/ time out/ is stuck in an infinite loop. Normally due to a logic error as well
Logic   =   You dun cucked up, something you wrote in your code is in correct syntax, but you wrote it in a way to make it screw itself and give you what you do not want. THE HARDEST ERROR TO FIX

*Indexing*
Java Script uses index 0.
"HelloWorld"
 0123456789
So the letter H would have a string index of 0, and W would have a string index of 5
