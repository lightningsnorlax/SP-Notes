*Basics*
Order 3X2:
A = 
columns |column
(20     |7)  row
(31     |9)  rwo
(13     |10) row
The above matrix is 3X2.
In matrixes, the number MXN represents the numbers of columns in M and the number of rows in N.
The element of a matrix is named xij, where i is the row, and j is the column of the matrix, and x is the refrence to the subject. (eg. the number 31 above is labelled a21)

*Transpose of a matrix*
The transpose of the above matrix is:
        column  column  column  
A^T =   (20     |31     |13) row
        (7      |9      |10) row
(A^T)^T just reverts the transposed matrix to it's original form

*Definitions*
Row vector          -   a one row matrix 
Column vector       -   a one column matrix
Zero matrix/    
Zero null           -   a matrix which has all entries of 0
Square matrix       -   a matrix with equal columns and rows
Symemetric matrix   -   a matrix where for all entries, xij = xji
Diagonal matrix     -   a square matrix where the top left to bottom right entries are not all zero, whilst the other elements are all zero
